All analyses were done in `R`.

The raw data consist of 5 files:

`stream_metadata.csv` contains stream physicochemical data such as:
location, width, depth, annual temperature, and discharge summaries
(e.g., median Q, max Q, etc.).

`jul_nutrients.csv` contains summarize dissolved nutrient values from
July 2012

`BOM_volumes.csv` contains sample and subsample volumes from individual
samples

`DM.csv` contains measured drymass and organic matter calculations from
individual subtypes,
