All analyses were done in `R`.

The raw data consist of  `r length(list.files("./data/derived_data/"))` files:

`stream_metadata.csv` contains stream physicochemical data such as: location, width, depth, annual temperature, and discharge summaries (e.g., median Q, max Q, etc.).

`jul_nutrients.csv` contains summarize dissolved nutrient values from July 2012

`BOM_volumes.csv` contains sample and subsample volumes from individual samples

`DM.csv` contains measured drymass and organic matter calculations from individual subtypes,
