All analyses were done in `R` [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

The file structure of this repository is:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree()
```

The raw data consist of  `r length(list.files("./data/raw_data/"))` files:

`stream_metadata.csv` contains stream physicochemical data such as: location, width, depth, annual temperature, and discharge summaries (e.g., median Q, max Q, etc.).

`jul_nutrients.csv` contains summarize dissolved nutrient values from July 2012

`BOM_volumes.csv` contains sample and subsample volumes from individual samples

`DM.csv` contains measured drymass and organic matter content calculations from individual subtypes

`cutC.csv` contains carbon and nitrogen concentrations for large macro primary producers (e.g., macrophytes, brophytes, etc.)

`PerCN.csv` contains carbon and nitrogen concentrations for non-macro BOM subtypes

`PerP.csv` contains phophorus concentrations for all sample subtypes
